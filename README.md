# ML-Pipeline
This project demonstrates a comprehensive machine learning pipeline using ColumnTransformer to handle both categorical and numerical data preprocessing. Categorical features are imputed with a constant value and one-hot encoded, while numerical features are imputed with the mean and scaled using StandardScaler. The pipeline then applies a LogisticRegression model for classification. Additionally, the pipeline supports dimensionality reduction for feature compression, providing a flexible solution for diverse datasets. This workflow ensures robust data preprocessing and modeling in a single streamlined process.
